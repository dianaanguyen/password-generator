# Password Generator

# Your task
This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

# Password Generator
This application uses the language JavaScript to generate a random password based on the user's criterias such as : how many characters they want in the password, if they want to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, or special characters. Clicking on the generate password button will activate the prompts to which the user answers, and a password will appear in the box.
